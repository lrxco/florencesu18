				<br> <h1> what's going on here? </h1>
				<p> once upon a time in the long ago year of 2012, someone made an account on the blogging platform tumblr. for reasons unknown, that blog has been consistently updated and maintained since then. around 2015, that person &ndash; who knew pitifully little code, and knows only slightly more now &ndash; applied a very beautiful but complicated theme to the blog, then modified it to suit the desired look by filtering the content into two columns, defining image sizes, and setting up infinite scroll, among other things. unfortunately, because they knew next to nothing about html and css, the end result worked... up to a certain point. scrolling too far down created a glitching effect in which individual posts were combined, stacked, and otherwise manipulated in their interactions with one another. surprisingly, however, the display errors were themselves compelling. that bad coding job has formed the basis for the collection you see on this site: all the images presented here are screenshots of the glitching blog as it created new art out of the raw content it was fed. </p> <br>

				<p> <em> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; left: the intended display layout; right: the glitching in action </em> </p>
				<br>
				<h1> wait, these pictures are from 2012? </h1>
				<p> no; the selection here is from roughly 2015 onward in order to more accurately capture the content the theme was chosen to suit. earlier content had its own tailored theme that is not longer applicable. also, the early stuff is embarrassing. </p> <br>
				<h1> why'd you choose this for your project? </h1>
				<p> partly because the meta-collection element was too appealing to turn away from &ndash; the component pieces of each collage are themselves part of a larger collection, and this appropriates them into another, differently-curated collection, transforming them from single images into multifaceted collages. also, partly because the collages are in and of themselves.... cool. </p> <br>
				<h1> can i see the blog? </h1>
				<p> no. </p> <br>
				<h1> ok, i'm ready to go back to the collection. </h1>
				<p> <a href="collectionsite.html"> enjoy your visit! </a> </p> <br>
