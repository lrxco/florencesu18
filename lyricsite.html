				<h5> Verse 1 </h5>
			</div>
				<p> 
					You threw your books into the river <br>
					Told your Mom that you're a nonbeliever <br>
					She says she wasn't surprised but that doesn't make it ok <br>
				</p>
			<div class="titlev">
				<h5> Verse 2 </h5>
			</div>
				<p>
					You say nobody loves a city <br>
					Nobody loves what can't love 'em back <br>
					One-way ticket in your pocket <br>
					What happened to the charm of a small town? <br>
				</p>
			<h5> Chorus </h5>
				<p>
					If you find what you're looking for <br>
					Be sure to send a postcard <br>
					You promised you'd never forget <br>
					The little ones when you got big <br>
				</p>
			<div class="titlev">
				<h5> Verse 3 </h5>
			</div>
				<p>
					You deal an unspoken debt <br>
					No kindness without wanting something back <br>
					What do I owe you? What did I forget? <br>
					Are we even after all of that? <br>
				</p>
			<div class="titlev">
				<h5> Verse 4 </h5>
			</div>
				<p>
					You shook my hand and said goodbye <br>
					You'll never let me see you cry again <br>
					What good has come from learning to pretend? <br>
					You said I could've been a better friend <br>
				</p>
			<h5> Chorus </h5>
				<p> 
					If you find what you're looking for <br>
					Be sure to send a new address<br>
					And if you find what you're looking for <br>
					Write a letter and tell us what it is, and tell us what it is <br>
				</p>
			<h5> Outro </h5>
				<p> 
				Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
