        <p class="introtext topintext"> Trick question! No one does. We go to museums to get up close and personal with works of art for ourselves, not to be stuck in static crowds and catch only momentary glimpses of the pieces. The issue is only exacerbated by the elaborate safety mechanisms in place to protect the art – which, of course, we all support, but isn't there a better way to balance safety and the many aspects of the visitor experience? <br> <br> </p> <p class="miniheading" id="two" data-spy="scroll"> <br> <br>  Let's look at some of the solutions museums have tried: </p>

          <p class="lead"> <br>  While certainly an effective means of keeping people away from art, barriers present a number of challenges. For one, they are almost always permanent, which restricts the layout of the room and what pieces could even potentially occupy it. Additionally, they are a significant interruption of the viewer's experience of the piece, especially when the piece is large enough that the barrier obstructs part of it. <br> <br>  Curiously, barriers like these also tend to invite intrusion, like visitors leaning on a railing for rest in the absence of a chair, which causes additional hassle and false alarms for security guards. They also present a small degree of danger for visitors: the wooden bar around the Mona Lisa has another semi-permanent divider around it to prevent visitors from being crushed in the throng of people trying to get close to the painting. <br> <br> One small perk that they do present is flexiblity with regard to the presentation of information about the artwork – by mounting a name card on the barrier, the museum is able to conserve a small amount of wall space.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading"> The Rope <span class="text-muted"> not as permanent, but slightly more dangerous </span></h2>
          <p class="lead"> <br> The ropes make up an interesting category due to their mutability: they can be temporary or permanent, large or small, long or short, intrusive or barely-there. The biggest issue that they present is that they are usually somewhat ineffective. While people tend to obey the fact that there is an obstruction, they are just as easily ignored, either by leaning or stepping over – especially by children, who pose a significant threat to fragile or delicate things in general. <br> <br>  There is also the issue of visitor safety, since they are essentially tripwires. This makes them unsuitable for use in crowded areas, as their utility instead becomes a danger due to the number of people in the space and the subsequent lack of awareness. <br> <br> Ultimately, the rope is more about shaping people's behavior than actually protecting the works themselves, and, while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it only works well in specific scenarios, making it a suboptimal choice for most exhibitions and museums. </p>

          <p class="lead"> <br>  Yes, this kind of barrier is certainly the most subtle of the three. In fact, one almost feels as if there is no barrer... that is, until a visitor accidentally trigger the alarm. Suddenly, everyone in the vicinity is on high alert, and they are no longer able to immerse themselves in the art and the museum experience. The resulting anxiety significantly detracts from the intended subtlety of the design. <br> <br>  Lines also do not themselves provide much real protection for the artwork, which greatly impairs their value. Without some secondary means, such as a glass panel or a security guard nearby, they do not guarantee actual safety, just a sense of security. <br> <br> While well-suited for sculptural or 3D work, especially large-scale examples, the method is, like the ropes, better for individual usage rather than museum-wide security, demonstrating a need for a similarly unobtrusive, but functional, barrier. </p>

        <p class="introtext movedown lowintext"> This design was influenced by other passive barriers that exist in daily life around Florence, such as the height difference between a sidewalk, bike path, and road that creates an open but categorized space and the train platforms that use discomfort to keep riders away from the edge. It also draws inspiration from naturally-occuring barriers like cliffs and riverbanks. Think of it like playing "The Floor is Lava," but with real-world applications! <br> <span id="four" data-spy="scroll"> <br> </p> <p class="miniheading"> <br> <br> The design is based on 3 central questions: </p>

        <div class="col-md-7">
          <h2 class="featurette-heading"> To start, <span class="text-muted"> how can we best protect the art? </span></h2>
          <p class="lead"> <br> elevART creates a passive barrier around the artwork that is, at its closest point, 10 inches away from a work of art and 6 inches off the ground. This degree of elevation will disincentivize stepping off the platform and onto the alarmed floor while also providing a significant visual cue to keep away from the edge. <br> <br>  Visitors are also encouraged to stay safely towards the middle of the platform by a 2-inch wide strip of bumps which are themselves an inch away from the edge, which will cause a minor degree of discomfort to stand on like those on train platforms do. This will hopefully override the instinct to step down towards the art. <br> <br> A pressure- and motion-sensitive alarm system will also be embedded in the floor to alert both museum security of a boundary violation and the visitor of their error, in the event that is was accidental. This should allow visitors who take advantage of the closer sections to lean slightly closer in to the work. Ideally, the piece itself would have its own contact-triggered alarm as well, creating a collaborative security system that will reduce risk of harm to the artwork. </p>

          <p class="lead"> <br>  elevART's design allows visitors to engage with the artwork in two ways, depending on what they want to get out of their visit to the museum. The model is not restrictive, however, so individuals can partake in both methods at varying times if they wish. <br> <br> The section of the pathway closer to the center of the room allows a visitor more interested in seeing the highlights for the sake of having seen them to do so from an ideal, frontal angle, which is perfect for the Kodak moment. This comes at the slight cost of being further from the art itself and having less time with the work due to being part of the 'current' of the river. <br> <br> The section closer to the walls, on the other hand, brings the visitor up close and personal with the piece in eddy-like protrusions, which allows them to stop and study the details without having to fight through a crowd. The cost of this choice is that the position is slightly 'worse' and off to the side. These spaces are also large enough for students and professionals to sit and work from without interrupting the experience of others. </p>

          <p class="lead"> <br>  The first way this is accomplished is by having two 'separate' channels for individuals to move within and between as detailed above (right: eddy areas indicated in red). The second way is by using curves and narrowings of the pathway to restrict or encourage movement, which people will subconsciously process in order to decide how to move through the area. The wider areas use the incentive of space to keep the narrower prime viewing location from becoming congested. <br> <br>  The platform fits 2-3 people shoulder to shoulder at its narrowest, which should encourage a relatively steady flow of traffic around the circuit without rushing visitors past something they might have wanted to see or causing congestion around a piece. <br> <br> The platforms also subtly encourage movement in only one direction rather than both, which will alleviate the potential for stagnant crowds to form. In this way, visitors will be channeled from room to room, but still maintain some element of control over their experience. </p>
