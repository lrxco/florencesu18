			<p class="verse1"> 
				You threw your books into the river <br>
				Told your Mom that you're a nonbeliever <br>
				She says she wasn't surprised but that doesn't make it ok <br>
			</p>
			<p class="verse2">
				You say nobody loves a city <br>
				Nobody loves what can't love 'em back <br>
				One-way ticket in your pocket <br>
				What happened to the charm of a small town? <br>
			</p>
			<p class="chorus1">
				If you find what you're looking for <br>
				Be sure to send a postcard <br>
				You promised you'd never forget <br>
				The little ones when you got big <br>
			</p>
			<p class="verse3">
				You deal an unspoken debt <br>
				No kindness without wanting something back <br>
				What do I owe you? What did I forget? <br>
				Are we even after all of that? <br>
			</p>
			<p class="verse4">
				You shook my hand and said goodbye <br>
				You'll never let me see you cry again <br>
				What good has come from learning to pretend? <br>
				You said I could've been a better friend <br>
			</p>
			<p class="chorus2">
				If you find what you're looking for <br>
				Be sure to send a new address<br>
				And if you find what you're looking for <br>
				Write a letter and tell us what it is, and tell us what it is <br>
			</p>
			<p class="outro"> 
				Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out <br>
